From our childhood years to where we are today, many things about the way that we live, work, and play have changed for the better. All these would not be possible without the innovative and creative minds of those willing and wanting to catalyse that change.

As part of the Singapore Public Service, you can play a more direct part in realising the next generation of advancements that our society needs. Through cross-collaboration with the many different agencies, the Public Service works as one to bring about positive evolutions to our community at large through the fields of science, technology, and engineering. We are looking for dreamers, synergisers, doers, and makersâ€”and you can be one of them.

We invite you to dare to dream about how our world could be better. It's time to discover, debunk, and decide your next steps in the realm of science, technology, and engineering. 

CTRL your future and SHIFT your perspectives with us.
