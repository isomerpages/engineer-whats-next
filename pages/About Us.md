Be prepared to CTRL your future and SHIFT your perspectives with a brand-new take on the many exciting possibilities with Science, Technology and Engineering (STE).
 
Science, Technology and Engineering (STE) empowers people to create impactful and meaningful solutions that pave the way forward for a nation. In the Singapore Public Service, we nurture our young into passionate individuals who deliver real and quantifiable change through innovation and team collaborations. Be a part of this workforce as we journey together.
 
**What is CTRL+SHIFT?**<br>
Evolving from the Engineering What's Next campaign in 2016 and the STE What's Next campaign in 2020, the CTRL+SHIFT campaign aims to shift the perspectives of students and influencers alike for STE courses and careers in the Public Service.
 
**Why CTRL+SHIFT?**<br>
CTRL+SHIFT brings you a fresh perspective of STE in the Public Service that you have never known, or never seen. How do you brew the idea of creating a mozzie breed to curb dengue? Or build a robot that goes through places you rather not be in? Sneak a peek at the restricted areas from the public sector agencies as they open their doors to you for the first time... we are sure you will be in for a special surprise!
 
Join us as CTRL+SHIFT unveils a whole new world in Science, Technology and Engineering!
