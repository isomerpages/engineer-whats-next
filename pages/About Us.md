Be prepared to CTRL your future and SHIFT your perspectives with a brand new take on the many exciting possibilities in Science, Tech and Engineering (STE).

With STE being prominent in the way we live, work and play – it has become inevitable for us and continues to evolve to this day. Playing a big part in STE history being made is the Singapore Public Service sector, a living machine of different agencies coming together to create a better Singapore. 

To some, the STE field paints a stoic image that goes by the book, but this is where we debunk that. We’re here to take you on a journey into the realm of STE and uncover how you can be dreamers, synergisers and innovators for the future. 

Join us as CTRL+SHIFT unveils a whole new world in Science, Tech and Engineering.
