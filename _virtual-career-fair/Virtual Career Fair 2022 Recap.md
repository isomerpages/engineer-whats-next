A huge thank you to all who joined our STE Virtual Career Fair 2022, jointly organised by the Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office (S&TPPO) and the Public Service Division (PSD).
 
We heard lots of insights, exciting experiences, and career advice from our STE Professionals, as well as many interesting questions by our participants! Here are the recordings of the event, in case you missed it or want to watch it again.

**Introduction**

**Whoâ€™s Who Segment**
To kick-start the event, we had a little game where we got the participants to guess who is NOT from the public sector, while our guests share about their day-to-day responsibilities, and what kind of projects they get to work on.

**Growth Segment**
Next, we dived deeper and learn more about what our S, T and E Professionals have been up to, challenges they have faced, and the exciting experiences they have gained, while working in the public sector.

**Fireside Segment**
The final segment was when participants got up close and personal with our four STE Professionals in the Growth Segment, where they can ask questions and find out more about each agency.

There's more! Leading up to the event, these STE Professionals made their debut on TikTok. Did you manage to catch 'em all?
